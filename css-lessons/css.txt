## ABOUT CSS ##
 
*CSS Syntax

-Selector - like variables in programming
-Declaration - style attributes separated by semicolons. (selector) {Declaration}
	Declaration has 2 parts:
	-Property - characteristic you want to access/modify. Ex: 'color','font',etc.
	-Value - value of the property. It can be: 'px','%',etc.

	(selector) {(property):(value);}
Ex:	h1 {color:blue;text-align:center;}



*CSS Selector

- Selects the html elements base on their selector and/or element name

	h1 {color:blue;text-align:center;}

- Here, all <h1> elements will be color blue and aligned to center.


CSS ID Selector 
- The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific 
element. The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to 
select one unique element. To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) 
character, followed by the id of the element.

	In CSS:
	#para1 {
		text-align: center;
		color: red;
	}

	Render in HTML:
	<p id="para1">Hello World</p>


CSS Class Selector
- The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute. To select 
elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class 
name.

	In CSS:
	.center {
		text-align: center;
		color: red;
	}

	Render in HTML:
	<p class="">Hello World</p>

- You can also specify what HTML tag should be afftected: p.center {code}


-HTML elements can also refer to more than one class.

	In CSS:
	.center {
		text-align: center;
		color: red;
	}

	.large {
		font-size: 300%;
	}

	Render in HTML:
	<p class="center large">Hello World</p>


CSS Grouping Selector
- CSS grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.

	h2 {
		text-align: center;
		color: red;
	}

	p {
		text-align: center;
		color: red;
	}

- They have the same code so we can do:
	
	h2,p {
		text-align: center;
		color: red;
	}


CSS Universal Selector
- It will render on all tags even if you dont render it. CSS: * {color:blue;}



*Adding CSS
Three Ways to Insert CSS:
	-External CSS - by importing
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

	-Internal CSS - style tag inside the head tag in html
		<head>
			<style>
				.styles {}
			</style>
		</head>

	-Inline CSS - style attributes by line
		<p style="">Hello World</p>



*CSS Colors

Background Color
- A style attribute that change the background color of the HTML element selected. EX:

	<h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Hello World</h1>


Text Color
- A style attribute that change the text color of selected element. EX:

	<h1 style="color:Tomato;">Hello World</h1>


Border Color
- style attribute for border colors. EX:

	<h1 style="border:2px solid Tomato;">Hello World</h1>


Color Values
- Besides of using color names lik 'Tomato', you can also use rgb,hex and hsl values:

	<h1 style="background-color:rgb(255, 99, 71);">...</h1>
	<h1 style="background-color:#ff6347;">...</h1>
	<h1 style="background-color:hsl(9, 100%, 64%);">...</h1>

	<!-- Same as color tomato but 50% transparent -->
	<h1 style="background-color:rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.5);">...</h1>
	<h1 style="background-color:hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.5);">...</h1>


--RGB Colors - rgb(red, blue, green)
- Defines the color intesity between 0 - 255. For example, (255,0,0) is red, 
(0,0,0) is black and (225,255,255) is white.

RGBA Value - rgba(red, blue, green, alpha)
- alpha parameter is the number between 0.0 and 0.1 that controlls the transparency


--HEX/Hexadecimal Colors - #rrggbb
- Counts in between of 00 - ff. How to count in HEX? First count from 00 to 09 followed by 
0a - 0f and next of it is 10 means the f is the greatest single value. #ff0000 is red, 
#00000 is black and #ffffff is white.

3 Digit HEX Color - #rgb
- Only applicable if values of each component (rr,gg and bb) has the same value (means r = r, and 
so on).


--HSL Colors - hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)
- Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue. 
Saturation is a percentage value, 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.
Lightness is also a percentage, 0% is black, 50% is neither light or dark, 100% is white.

  Saturation can be described as the intensity of a color. 100% is pure color, no shades of 
gray 50% is 50% gray, but you can still see the color. 0% is completely gray, you can no 
longer see the color.

  The lightness of a color can be described as how much light you want to give the color, 
where 0% means no light (black), 50% means 50% light (neither dark nor light) 100% means full 
lightness (white).

  Shades of gray are often defined by setting the hue and saturation to 0, and adjust the 
lightness from 0% to 100% to get darker/lighter shades.

--HSLA Color - hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)
- Just like we discuss earlier, it also controlls the transparency: hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 0.5)



*CSS Background
- Except from colors, there are plenty of background you could use for CSS like image, etc.
- Now we will learn about: background-color, background-image, background-repeat, 
background-attachment, background-position, background(shorthand property)


CSS background-color
- "background-color" property specifies background color of the element.


--Opacity/ Transparency
- "opacity" property controlls the transparency of an element.

	div {
		background-color: green;
		opacity: 0.3;
	}

-Its con is all of the elements inside the element where you put it will be also affected 
(like p tags). You can controll the opacity/transparency using this or using what we discuss 
earlier about alpha.


CSS background-image
- "background-image" property allows you to use an image to use as a background of an element.
- By the default, the image is repeated to cover the chosen whole page. In using image backgrounds,
you should use a  not disturbing picture.

	body {
		background-image: url("paper.gif");
	}


CSS background-repeat
- Image background can repeat automatically but on some images, it looks like a mess like  
when you use the gradiented bottom image, you're seeing the bounds of the first one and the 
repeated one. In this cases, "background-repeat" property should use.

- If the image repeated horizontally, you should use "background-repeat: repeat-x;" for x axis:

	body {
		background-image: url("gradient_bg.png");
		background-repeat: repeat-x;
	}

- And if you want to repeat an image vertically, use "background-repeat: repeat-y;"

--CSS no-repeat background
- Show image background only once by "background-image: no-repeat;"


CSS background-position
- For positiioning your background, mostly useful if you have an image/icon background.

	body {
		background-image: url("img_tree.png");
		background-repeat: no-repeat;
		background-position: right top;
		margin-right: 200px;
	}


CSS background-attachment
- "background-attachment" property specifies whether the background image should scroll or be 
fixed (will not scroll with the rest of the page).

	body {
		background-image: url("img_tree.png");
		background-repeat: no-repeat;
		background-position: right top;
		background-attachment: fixed;
	}

- If you want to scroll it: "background-attachment: scroll;"


CSS background-shorthand property
- Instead of typing this:

	body {
		background-color: #ffffff;
		background-image: url("img_tree.png");
		background-repeat: no-repeat;
		background-position: right top;
	}

- Use this:

	body {
		background: #ffffff url("img_tree.png") no-repeat right top;
	}

- When you're using the shorthand, the format is:
	{background:
		background-color 
		background-image 
		background-repeat 
		background-attachment
		background-position;
	}

- It's ok if one of them is missing, the important is they are in right order.
